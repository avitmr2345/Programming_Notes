							 Web 3.0 (Blockchain Developer)
Web 3.0 is the next generation of the internet that aims to decentralize control and empower individuals. It is built on blockchain technology, which allows for secure and transparent transactions without the need for intermediaries. In Web 3.0, users have more control over their data and can directly interact with decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.
Benefits of Web 3.0 -
Decentralization: Web 3.0 eliminates the need for centralized authorities, giving more power to individuals and reducing the risk of censorship or manipulation.
Transparency: Transactions and data on the blockchain are transparent and can be verified by anyone, ensuring trust and accountability.
Security: Blockchain technology provides a high level of security, making it difficult for hackers to tamper with data or transactions.
Ownership of Data: Users have control over their own data and can choose how and when to share it, reducing the reliance on centralized platforms.

Blockchain -
Blockchain is a distributed and decentralized ledger technology that allows multiple parties to maintain a shared database without the need for a central authority. A ledger is a record-keeping system that tracks transactions and balances.
Transactions are verified and added to the blockchain through a consensus mechanism, such as proof-of-work or proof-of-stake.
How Blockchain Works -
Decentralization: Instead of a central authority, blockchain relies on a network of computers (nodes) to maintain the database.
Consensus Mechanism: Nodes in the network agree on the validity of transactions and reach a consensus on adding them to the blockchain.
Cryptography: Transactions are secured using cryptographic algorithms, ensuring the integrity and privacy of the data.
Blocks and Chains: Transactions are grouped into blocks, which are linked together in a chain. Each block contains a reference to the previous block, forming a chronological sequence.
Mining: In some blockchain networks, miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to validate transactions and add them to the blockchain. Miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency for their efforts.

Hashing -
Hashing is a technique used in blockchain to ensure data integrity and immutability.
The hash function converts the message into a fixed-length string of characters, known as a hash code or hash value.
Hashing is a one-way process, meaning it is computationally infeasible to reverse-engineer the original message from the hash code.
Even a small change in the input message will result in a completely different hash code.
Hashing is deterministic, meaning that the same input will always produce the same hash code.
Hashing is used to verify the integrity of data in a blockchain by comparing the hash of a block with the previous block's hash. If any data in the block is altered, the hash will change, indicating tampering.
The SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit) is a popular hash algorithm used in blockchain.
Reversing the hash function to obtain the original message is known as "brute-forcing."
Brute-forcing involves trying every possible input until a match is found, which can be time-consuming and computationally expensive.
The larger the input space (e.g., larger numbers), the more difficult it becomes to reverse the hash function.
In real-world cryptography, hash functions operate on numbers that are hundreds of digits long.In 2019, researchers took 900 years of computing power to find the factors of a number with 240 digits.
Cryptographic hash functions are designed to be secure against brute-force attacks, making it extremely difficult to find the original input from the hash value.

Block Formation -
Each block in the blockchain contains a piece of data, such as a transaction.
To add a block to the blockchain, a hash must be generated for the data.
The hash serves as the identifier for the block.
In order for a block to be added to the blockchain, it must satisfy a predetermined requirement.
For example, the hash may need to start with a certain number of zeros.
Immutability and Integrity
Once a block is added to the blockchain, it becomes extremely difficult to alter or tamper with.
Changing any data within a block would result in a different hash.
This would break the chain of hashes and invalidate the entire blockchain.
Therefore, the blockchain ensures the immutability and integrity of the data it contains.

Conclusion -
Blockchain utilizes one-way functions and hashing to create a secure and tamper-proof ledger.
The use of hashes ensures the uniqueness and integrity of each block in the blockchain.
This technology provides a reliable and transparent way to record and verify transactions.

Decentralized applications (DApps) - 
They are the backbone of Web 3.0, the next iteration of the Internet. Creating and funding DApps brings about a significant change in the way companies are formed and new tech startups are built. Let's explore how DApps are created and the new opportunities they offer:
Traditional Startup Model vs. Web 3.0 Model -
In the traditional startup model:
Build the startup and technology.
Deploy the technology.
Raise venture capital (VC) funding.
Potentially IPO and cash out.
In the Web 3.0 model:
Build the startup and technology.
Start releasing tokens to the public or funds like VCs.
Sell tokens that enable people to use and interact with the technology.
Start raising money for the DApp from day one.

Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) -
The blockchain technology behind DApps also transforms the way companies are run. DAOs, or decentralized autonomous organizations, replace the traditional board of directors and organizational chart of a company. In a DAO:
Token holders have special tokens called governance tokens.
Governance tokens allow token holders to vote on the future actions of the company or DApp.
Users can contribute to the roadmap of the decentralized application.

Pseudonymity and Privacy -
One of the significant advantages of Web 3.0 is pseudonymity, which provides privacy and allows individuals to participate in online activities without revealing personal information such as their address or real identity.
This feature promotes a level playing field where recognition and rewards are based on the value individuals create rather than their personal attributes such as age, race, or gender.

Internet Computer -
The Internet computer is a powerful and secure blockchain that aims to run the entire base layer of the web.
It provides a protocol that combines hosting, storage, and services in one secure platform.
The goal of the Internet computer is to achieve blockchain singularity, where decentralized applications (Dapps) can operate fully on the blockchain without relying on centralized infrastructure.
The Internet Computer is a revolutionary approach to scaling blockchain smart contracts. It addresses the limitations of traditional blockchains by introducing a novel consensus algorithm called threshold relay. This algorithm allows the Internet Computer to achieve faster speeds and process thousands of computations per second.

Working of Internet Computer -
Aggregating compute capacity: The Internet Computer combines the compute capacity of a large number of independent data centers worldwide. These data centers are connected using the Internet Computer protocol, creating a decentralized world computer. By aggregating the compute capacity of independent data centers, the Internet Computer achieves a high level of decentralization. This ensures that no single entity has control over the network, enhancing security and trust.

Canisters: The decentralized computer is organized into individual units called canisters or canister smart chains. Each canister can run processes, execute code, and store data for programs.

Accessing canisters: As a user, you can interact with canisters directly by making HTTPs requests. This allows you to utilize the functionality provided by the canisters.

Writing code: As a developer, you can write code that compiles into a performant web application using webassembly. The Internet Computer supports multiple programming languages such as Rust or Dfinity's Motoko.

Memory management: Canisters have a unique way of managing memory. Your program state, including variables, collections, and arrays, can be stored within the canister itself. This allows for efficient memory utilization and storage of program data. Canisters on the Internet Computer act as a process or a code sandbox. They preserve the program state, allowing the canister to run indefinitely. This means that data stored in variables, such as collections, arrays, dictionaries, or objects, remains intact and does not get wiped. As a developer, you don't have to worry about data persistence or managing databases because the canister behaves as if it never gets killed.
