								OOP 1
A class is a template for an object and a class creates a new data type that can be used to create objects.
When you declare an object of a class, you are creating an instance of that class.
Thus, a class is a logical construct and an object has physical reality. (That is, an object occupies space in memory.)

Objects are characterized by three essential properties: state, identity, and behavior.
The state of an object is a value from its data type. The identity of an object distinguishes one object from another.
It is useful to think of an object’s identity as the place where its value is stored in memory.
The behavior of an object is the effect of data-type operations.

The dot operator links the name of the object with the name of an instance variable.
Although commonly referred to as the dot operator, the formal specification for Java categorizes the . as a separator.
The 'new' keyword dynamically allocates(that is, allocates at run time) memory for an object & returns a reference to it.
This reference is, more or less, the address in memory of the object allocated by 'new' and is then stored in the variable.
Thus, in Java, all class objects must be dynamically allocated.

Box mybox; // declare reference to object 
mybox = new Box(); // allocate a Box object
The first line declares mybox as a reference to an object of type Box. At this point, mybox does not yet refer to an actual object. The next line allocates an object and assigns a reference to it to mybox. After the second line executes, you can use mybox as if it were a Box object. But in reality, mybox simply holds, in essence, the memory address of the actual Box object.
The key to Java’s safety is that you cannot manipulate references as you can actual pointers.
Thus, you cannot cause an object reference to point to an arbitrary memory location or manipulate it like an integer.

A Closer Look at new:
classname class-var = new classname();
Here, class-var is a variable of the class type being created. The classname is the name of the class that is being instantiated. The class name followed by parentheses specifies the constructor for the class. A constructor defines what occurs when an object of a class is created.
It is important to understand that new allocates memory for an object during run time.

You might be wondering why you do not need to use new for such things as integers or characters.
The answer is that Java’s primitive types are not implemented as objects.
Rather, they are implemented as “normal” variables. This is done in the interest of efficiency.

Box b1 = new Box();
Box b2 = b1;
b1 and b2 will both refer to the same object. When you assign one object reference variable to another object reference variable, you are not creating a copy of the object, you are only making a copy of the reference.

int square(int i){
    return i * i;
}
A parameter is a variable defined by a method that receives a value when the method is called. For example, in square(int i), i is a parameter. An argument is a value that is passed to a method when it is invoked.
For example, square(100) passes 100 as an argument. Inside square(), the parameter i receives that value.

Bus bus = new Bus();
lhs(reference i.e. bus) is looked by compiler & rhs (object i.e. new Bus()) is looked by jvm.

The this Keyword:
Sometimes a method will need to refer to the object that invoked it. To allow this, Java defines the this keyword. 'this' can be used inside any method to refer to the current object. That is, this is always a reference to the object on which the method was invoked.

final Keyword:
A field can be declared as final. Doing so prevents its contents from being modified, making it, essentially, a constant.
This means that you must initialize a final field when it is declared.
It is a common coding convention to choose all uppercase identifiers for final fields:
	final int FILE_OPEN = 2;

Unfortunately, final guarantees immutability only when instance variables are primitive types, not reference types.
If an instance variable of a reference type has the final modifier, the value of that instance variable (the reference to an object) will never change—it will always refer to the same object—but the value of the object itself can change.
	final Student avish = new Student("Avish");
	avish.name = "Avi";
	avish = new Student("Rahul");  //it is not allowed

The finalize() Method:
Sometimes an object will need to perform some action when it is destroyed.
To handle such situations, Java provides a mechanism called finalization. By using finalization, you can define specific actions that will occur when an object is just about to be reclaimed by the garbage collector.
To add a finalizer to a class, you simply define the finalize() method. The Java run time calls that method whenever it is about to recycle an object of that class. Right before an asset is freed, the Java run time calls the finalize() method on the object.

protected void finalize() {
    // finalization code here
}

Constructors:
Once defined, the constructor is automatically called when the object is created, before the new operator completes.
Constructors look a little strange because they have no return type, not even void.
This is because the implicit return type of a class constructor is the class type itself.

Box mybox1 = new Box();
new Box() is calling the Box() constructor.

Inheritance and constructors in Java:
In Java, constructor of base class with no argument gets automatically called in derived class constructor.
For example, output of following program given below is:

Base Class Constructor Called
Derived Class Constructor Called

class Base {
  Base() {
    System.out.println("Base Class Constructor Called ");
  }
}

class Derived extends Base {
  Derived() {
    System.out.println("Derived Class Constructor Called ");
  }
}

public class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Derived d = new Derived();
  }
}

Any class will have a default constructor, does not matter if we declare it in the class or not. If we inherit a class, then the derived class must call its super class constructor. It is done by default in derived class.
If it does not have a default constructor in the derived class, the JVM will invoke its default constructor and call the super class constructor by default. If we have a parameterised constructor in the derived class still it calls the default super class constructor by default. In this case, if the super class does not have a default constructor, instead it has a parameterised constructor, then the derived class constructor should explicitly call the parameterised super class constructor.

								OOP 2
Packages are containers for classes. They are used to keep the class name space compartmentalized.
For example, a package allows you to create a class named List, which you can store in your own package without concern that it will collide with some other class named List stored elsewhere. Packages are stored in a hierarchical manner and are explicitly imported into new class definitions.
The package is both a naming and a visibility control mechanism.
The following statement creates a package called MyPackage: package MyPackage;

How does the Java run-time system know where to look for packages that you create? The answer has three parts.
- First, by default, the Java run-time system uses the current working directory as its starting point.
Thus, if your package is in a subdirectory of the current directory, it will be found.
- Second, you can specify a directory path or paths by setting the CLASSPATH environmental variable.
- Third, you can use the -classpath option with java and javac to specify the path to your classes.

When a package is imported, only those items within the package declared as public will be available to non-subclasses in the importing code.

Understanding static:
When a member is declared static, it can be accessed before any objects of its class are created, and without reference to any object. You can declare both methods and variables to be static. main() is declared as static because it must be called before any objects exist.
Static method in Java is a method which belongs to the class and not to the object.

A static method can access only static data. It cannot access non-static data (instance variables).
A non-static member belongs to an instance. It's meaningless without somehow resolving which instance of a class you are talking about. In a static context, you don't have an instance, that's why you can't access a non-static member without explicitly mentioning an object reference.
In fact, you can access a non-static member in a static context by specifying the object reference explicitly :
public class Human {

    String message = "Hello World";

    public static void display(Human human){
        System.out.println(human.message);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Human kunal = new Human();
        kunal.message = "Kunal's message";
        Human.display(kunal);
    }
}

A static method can call only other static methods and cannot call a non-static method from it.
A static method can be accessed directly by the class name and doesn’t need any object.
A static method cannot refer to "this" or "super" keywords in any way.

If you need to do computation in order to initialize your static variables, you can declare a static block that gets executed exactly once, when the class is first loaded.

// Demonstrate static variables, methods, and blocks.
     class UseStatic {
       static int a = 3;
       static int b;
       static void meth(int x) {
         System.out.println("x = " + x);
         System.out.println("a = " + a);
         System.out.println("b = " + b);
       }
       static {
         System.out.println("Static block initialized.");
         b = a * 4;
        }
       public static void main(String args[]) {
         meth(42);
    }
}

As soon as the UseStatic class is loaded, all of the static statements are run. First, a is set to 3, then the static block executes, which prints a message and then initializes b to a*4 or 12. Then main() is called, which calls meth(), passing 42 to x. The three println() statements refer to the two static variables a and b, as well as to the local variable x.
Here is the output of the program:
Static block initialized. x = 42
a = 3
b = 12
Note: main method is static, since it must be accessible for an application to run, before any instantiation takes place.

NOTE: Only nested classes can be static.
NOTE: Static inner classes can have static variables

You cant override the inherited static methods, as in java overriding takes place by resolving the type of object at run-time and not compile time, and then calling the respective method.
Static methods are class level methods, so it is always resolved during compile time.
Static INTERFACE METHODS are not inherited by either an implementing class or a sub-interface.

NOTE:
public class Static {

    // class Test  // ERROR
    static class Test{
        String name;

        public Test(String name) {
            this.name = name;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Test a = new Test("Kunal");

        Test b = new Test("Rahul");

        System.out.println(a.name); // Kunal
        System.out.println(b.name); // Rahul
    }
}
Because :
The static keyword may modify the declaration of a member type C within the body of a non-inner class or interface T.
Its effect is to declare that C is not an inner class. Just as a static method of T has no current instance of T in its body, C also has no current instance of T, nor does it have any lexically enclosing instances.
Here, test does not have any instance of it's outer class Static. Neither does main.
But main & Test can have instances of each other.

# NOTE: Although static methods can be inherited ,there is no point in overriding them in child classes because the method in parent class will run always no matter from which object you call it. That is why static interface methods cannot be inherited because these method will run from the parent interface and no matter if we were allowed to override them, they will always run the method in parent interface.
That is why static interface method must have a body.
Static method can be inherited but cannot be overridden because overriding depends on object type but static does not depends on objects. Hence static can not be overridden.

Singleton Class:
It is a class in which we can only create a single object or instance of a class.

								OOP 3
To inherit a class, you simply incorporate the definition of one class into another by using the extends keyword.

class subclass-name extends superclass-name { // body of class
}
You can only specify one superclass for any subclass that you create. Java does not support the inheritance of multiple superclasses into a single subclass. You can, as stated, create a hierarchy of inheritance in which a subclass becomes a superclass of another subclass. However, no class can be a superclass of itself.

Although a subclass includes all of the members of its superclass, it cannot access those members of the superclass that have been declared as private.

A Superclass Variable Can Reference a Subclass Object:
It is important to understand that it is the type of the reference variable not the type of the object that it refers to—that determines what members can be accessed.
When a reference to a subclass object is assigned to a superclass reference variable, you will have access only to those parts of the object defined by the superclass.

plainbox      =  weightbox;
(superclass)     (subclass)

SUPERCLASS ref = new SUBCLASS();    // HERE ref can only access methods which are available in SUPERCLASS

Using super:
Whenever a subclass needs to refer to its immediate superclass, it can do so by use of the keyword super.
super has two general forms. The first calls the superclass’ constructor.
The second is used to access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclass.

BoxWeight(double w, double h, double d, double m) {
    super(w, h, d); // call superclass constructor
    weight = m;
}

Here, BoxWeight( ) calls super( ) with the arguments w, h, and d. This causes the Box constructor to be called, which initializes width, height, and depth using these values. BoxWeight no longer initializes these values itself.
It only needs to initialize the value unique to it: weight. This leaves Box free to make these values private if desired.

Thus, super( ) always refers to the superclass immediately above the calling class.
This is true even in a multileveled hierarchy.

class Box {
     private double width;
     private double height;
     private double depth;

     // construct clone of an object

     Box(Box ob) { // pass object to constructor
       width = ob.width;
       height = ob.height;
       depth = ob.depth;
     }
}

class BoxWeight extends Box {
     double weight; // weight of box

     // construct clone of an object

     BoxWeight(BoxWeight ob) { // pass object to constructor
        super(ob);
        weight = ob.weight;
     }
}

Notice that super() is passed an object of type BoxWeight—not of type Box.This still invokes the constructor Box(Box ob).
NOTE: A superclass variable can be used to reference any object derived from that class.
Thus, we are able to pass a BoxWeight object to the Box constructor. Of course,Box only has knowledge of its own members.

A Second Use for super
The second form of super acts somewhat like this, except that it always refers to the superclass of the subclass in which it is used.

super.member

Here, member can be either a method or an instance variable. This second form of super is most applicable to situations in which member names of a subclass hide members by the same name in the superclass.

If you think about it, it makes sense that constructors complete their execution in order of derivation.
Because a superclass has no knowledge of any subclass, any initialization it needs to perform is separate from and possibly prerequisite to any initialization performed by the subclass. Therefore, it must complete its execution first.

NOTE: If super( ) is not used in subclass' constructor, then the default or parameterless constructor of each superclass will be executed.

Polymorphism:
It means many ways to represent a single entity.
Types of polymorphism are:
1. Compile Time/ Static Polymorphism -
Overloading Methods:
In Java, it is possible to define two or more methods within the same class that share the same name, as long as their parameter declarations are different.
While overloaded methods may have different return types, the return type alone is insufficient to distinguish two versions of a method. When Java encounters a call to an overloaded method, it simply executes the version of the method whose parameters match the arguments used in the call. In some cases, Java’s automatic type conversions can play a role in overload resolution.

class OverloadDemo {
    void test(double a){
        System.out.println("Inside test(double) a: " + a);
    }
}
class Overload {
     public static void main(String args[]) {
         OverloadDemo ob = new OverloadDemo();
         int i = 88;
         ob.test(i);        // this will invoke test(double)
         ob.test(123.2);    // this will invoke test(double)
     }
}
As you can see, this version of OverloadDemo does not define test(int). Therefore, when test( ) is called with an integer argument inside Overload, no matching method is found. However, Java can automatically convert an integer into a double, and this conversion can be used to resolve the call. Therefore, after test(int) is not found, Java elevates i to double and then calls test(double).
Of course, if test(int) had been defined, it would have been called instead.
Java will employ its automatic type conversions only if no exact match is found.

Returning Objects:

 // Returning an object.
       class Test {
           int a;
           Test(int i) {
               a = i;
           }
           Test incrByTen() {
               Test temp = new Test(a+10);
               return temp;
           }
       }
       class RetOb {
         public static void main(String args[]) {
           Test ob1 = new Test(2);
           Test ob2;
           ob2 = ob1.incrByTen();
           System.out.println("ob1.a: " + ob1.a);
           System.out.println("ob2.a: " + ob2.a);
       }
}
Output:
ob1.a: 2
ob2.a: 12

As you can see, each time incrByTen( ) is invoked, a new object is created, and a reference to it is returned to the calling routine.

2. Runtime / Dynamic Polymorphism - 
Overriding Methods:
In a class hierarchy, when a method in a subclass has the same name and type signature as a method in its superclass, then the method in the subclass is said to override the method in the superclass. When an overridden method is called from within its subclass, it will always refer to the version of that method defined by the subclass. The version of the method defined by the superclass will be hidden.

Method overriding occurs only when the names and the type signatures of the two methods are identical.
If they are not, then the two methods are simply overloaded.

Dynamic Method Dispatch:

Dynamic method dispatch is the mechanism by which a call to an overridden method is resolved at run time, rather than compile time. Dynamic method dispatch is important because this is how Java implements run-time polymorphism.
Let’s begin by restating an important principle: a superclass reference variable can refer to a subclass object.
When an overridden method is called through a superclass reference, Java determines which version of that method to execute based upon the type of the object being referred to at the time the call occurs. Thus, this determination is made at run time.
In other words, it is the type of the object being referred to (not the type of the reference variable) that determines which version of an overridden method will be executed.

NOTE : Polymorphism does not apply to instance variables.

Encapsulation vs Abstraction:
Encapsulation is a feature of OOPs. It hides the code and data into a single entity or unit so that the data can be protected from the outside world while Abstraction hides the unnecessary detail but shows the essential information.
Encapsulation solves an issue at implementaion level while Abstraction solves an issue at the design level.
Encapsulation focuses on internal working while Abstraction focuses on the external lookout.
Encapsulation can be implemented by using access modifiers while Abstraction can be implemented using abstract classes and interfaces.
Encapsulation is the process of containing the information while Abstraction is the process of gaining information.
Encapsulation use the getters and setters methods to hide the data while Abstraction use abstract classes and interfaces to hide the code complexities.

Using final with Inheritance:
The keyword final has three uses:

# First, it can be used to create the equivalent of a named constant.

# Using final to Prevent Overriding:
To disallow a method from being overridden, specify final as a modifier at the start of its declaration.
Methods declared as final cannot be overridden.
Methods declared as final can sometimes provide a performance enhancement: The compiler is free to inline calls to them because it “knows” they will not be overridden by a subclass.
Normally, Java resolves calls to methods dynamically, at run time. This is called late binding. However, since final methods cannot be overridden, a call to one can be resolved at compile time. This is called early binding.

# Using final to Prevent Inheritance:
Sometimes you will want to prevent a class from being inherited. To do this, precede the class declaration with final.
NOTE: Declaring a class as final implicitly declares all of its methods as final, too.
As you might expect, it is illegal to declare a class as both abstract and final since an abstract class is incomplete by itself & relies upon its subclasses to provide complete implementations.
