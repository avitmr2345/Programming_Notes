git init
git clone url						// it creates the repository on the device or we can say it copies the repo to device
git add . (or filename)

A commit in Git saves a snapshot of your tracked files. Git optimizes storage by saving deltas (changes) instead of full copies.
git commit -m "Message"

git push urlname branch				
git push -u origin main // push my local main to the remote origin/main, and -u option set origin/main as the upstream branch for local main
git push origin master -f				// force push
git pull
git remote -v						// lets you view remote repo URLs
git remote add origin(urlname) url (it attach the url with the project on your device)
git status
git log
git checkout -- filename				// discard changes in working directory
git checkout file.txt					// it rolls back this file to the previous version
git restore --staged filename or git rm --cached -r .	// it unstage files
git revert log_id
git reset --hard log_id
git stash						// temporarily save uncommitted changes
git stash pop						// restore stashed changes
git stash clear
git diff file.txt					// it check the difference of current version and last saved point

Branches are simply pointers to a specific commit -- nothing more.There is no storage / memory overhead with making many branches, it's easier to logically divide up your work than have big beefy branches. When we start mixing branches and commits, we will see how these two features combine. A branch essentially says "I want to include the work of this commit and all parent commits."
Merging combines changes from one branch into another. It creates a special commit with two parents, preserving both histories. Common use case: merge a feature branch back into main.
git branch branchName 					// creates a branch
git checkout branchName 				// to change branch
git switch branchName					// new command and alternative of checkout
git checkout -b [yourbranchname]			// creates a new branch AND check it out at the same time
git merge branchName
git mergetool						// resolve merge conflicts
git cherry-pick <commit>				// apply a specific commit to current branch

The second way of combining work between branches is rebasing (first was merging). Rebasing essentially takes a set of commits, "copies" them, and plops them down somewhere else.
Rebase moves your commits on top of another branch. It replays your changes to create a clean, linear history. Useful for tidying up before merging.
git checkout feature-x					// switch to your branch
git rebase main						// reapply feature-x commits onto main
Pick and squash- It is to simply merge many commits into single commits.
git rebase -i commit_id					// i means interactive environment

upstream is the name of the url from where you forked the project.
To maintain the upstream main branch with the fork main branch if something was merged in the upstream -
git fecth --all --prune			// it fecthes all the branches and prune is to fetch the deleted changes or commits too to your fork
git checkout main 
git reset --hard upstream/main				// resets the main branch of origin to the main branch of upstream
             or
git pull upstream main
